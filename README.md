# NLP Model Playground

Welcome to the NLP Model Playground! This repository contains various neural network models implemented for different NLP tasks.

## Models Included

- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**: A basic feedforward neural network trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**: (Coming soon) Implementation of RNN models for sequence data.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: (Coming soon) Implementation of CNN models for image-based NLP tasks.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/NLP-Model-Playground.git

2. Navigate to the desired model folder and open the Jupyter notebook.
3.Install the required dependencies (if any) using:
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells to train and evaluate the models.
